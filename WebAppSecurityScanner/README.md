Web Application Security Scanner
Overview
The Web Application Security Scanner is a comprehensive tool designed to detect and report on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. This tool is built in Python and covers a wide range of common security weaknesses, helping developers and security professionals identify and mitigate risks in their web applications.

Features
OWASP Top 10 Coverage: Detects vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Broken Access Control, Security Misconfiguration, Outdated Components, Identification & Authentication Failures, Software & Data Integrity Failures, Logging & Monitoring Failures, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and Cryptographic Failures.
Modular Architecture: Each vulnerability is handled by a dedicated module, making the tool extensible and easy to maintain.
Comprehensive Reporting: Generates detailed reports in JSON format, with options for HTML and PDF output under development.
Configuration Flexibility: Allows users to configure target URLs, payloads, and test parameters via a config.json file.
Logging: Provides detailed logging of the scanning process, making it easy to track the progress and diagnose issues.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-app-security-scanner.git
cd web-app-security-scanner
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python packages using requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Tool:

Edit the config/config.json file to specify the target URLs and other settings.

Example config.json:

json
Copy code
{
    "target_urls": [
        "https://example.com",
        "https://testsite.com"
    ],
    "scanner_settings": {
        "max_threads": 5,
        "timeout": 30
    }
}
Run the Scanner:

Execute the main.py script to start scanning:

bash
Copy code
python src/main.py
The results will be saved in the reports/ directory as a JSON file.

Modules
The scanner is organized into several modules, each targeting a specific type of vulnerability:

injection_test.py: SQL Injection detection.
xss_test.py: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection.
access_control_test.py: Broken Access Control detection.
security_misconfig_test.py: Security Misconfiguration detection.
outdated_components_test.py: Detection of vulnerable and outdated components.
auth_failures_test.py: Identification and Authentication Failures detection.
integrity_failures_test.py: Software and Data Integrity Failures detection.
logging_monitoring_test.py: Logging and Monitoring Failures detection.
ssrf_test.py: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) detection.
crypto_failures_test.py: Cryptographic Failures detection.
Roadmap
Enhanced Reporting: Implement HTML and PDF report generation.
Performance Optimization: Introduce asynchronous scanning for improved performance.
Advanced Configuration: Expand configuration options to allow for more granular control over the scanning process.
User Interface: Develop a web-based dashboard for managing scans and viewing reports.
